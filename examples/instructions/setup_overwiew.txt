Setup Overview Brunnen / Adaptive Clay Formations / SE MusicLab

1. planes and sequence (and IDs) generated by Edu's script:
G:\Shared drives\2020_MAS\T2_P1_BuildingWorkshop\03_design\generation GH ???

2. Copied to "Z:\planes_ready4fab.gh" as internalised nodes. 
	- This is just used for data exchange.

3. Copied to "G:\Shared drives\2020_MAS\T2_P1_BuildingWorkshop\02_robot_control\create_fab_data.gh".
	- Planes are transformed from WCS to RCS
	- Planes are then used (together with IDs optionally) to generate clay_bullet objects with some metadata.
	- Change the name to segment name, then save to JSON

4. "G:\Shared drives\2020_MAS\T2_P1_BuildingWorkshop\02_robot_control\path_planning.gh"
	- clay_bullets are loaded from JSON file from previous step.
	- Follow the steps in the file to generate path plan.
		- For now mostly tested using WSL ROS setup on Antons laptop, but works also with compas_rcf/src/compas_rcf/_compose_files/abb-planner/docker-compose.yml
		- Don't run both abb-driver compose file and abb-planner compose file. Compose down one and compose up the other. (Not while running fabrication from same laptop)
		- At the end you will have a new json file with clay_bullet objects with planned trajectories.
	- File requires:
		- Docker Desktop (or Docker toolbox but that's not well tested)
		- Plugin telepathy https://www.food4rhino.com/app/telepathy
		- compas_rcf https://compas_rcf.tetov.se/contributing.html#setup-1

5. Run fabrication file. (see rcf_brunnen_instructions.txt)
