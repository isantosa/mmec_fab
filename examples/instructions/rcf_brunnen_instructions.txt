Open anaconda using the desktop icon "abb_run_google_drive"
Run command "rcf_run -v -c real <filename>"
2AB (night 17 sept) is file "20200917-19.31.49-2AB-with-ppl.json"

So the command is: "rcf_run -v -c real 20200917-19.31.49-2AB-with-ppl.json"

If you need to stop and resume:

Run the file with the suffix IN_PROGRESS. In case there are many (they increase in count e.g. "-IN_PROGRESS01") take the latest.

If you terminated the program AFTER placing cylinder, then select "Start after last element marked as placed.".
If you terminated the program BEFORE placing cylinder, then select "Select start index" ..  And specfy one index before.
This is because the cylinder gets marked as placed directly after being picked.


rcf_run -v -c real 20200926-23.56.17-5E-0-4-with-ppl2.json
